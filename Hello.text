âœ… 3. View Bills
If a buyer purchases a product, store a bill entry in bills.txt:

Include: product_name, quantity, price, buyer, seller, timestamp.

In this seller option, filter bills where seller == current_seller_username.

ðŸ’¡ Hint: Use json.loads(line) to parse each bill entry, then match seller.
